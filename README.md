# Issues and Backlog

1: As of right now, the App does not support changing the default connection IP address or Port. Use LocalHost port 8001 (the default for VtubeStudio)

2: Done: ~~Adaptive Volume Ratios: Right now if a loud noise is processed, the volume ratio will permanently be stuck based on the singular loud noise. Next version will have adaptive volume ratios to remedy this issue.~~

3: ToDo: Option to split left/right tracks for stereo audio and double the number of parameters.
